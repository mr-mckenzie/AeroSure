            <p>This is no ordinary weather app! <i>AeroSure</i> takes a user's departure and arrival location alongside the scheduled departure arrival times. Then with the help of <a href="https://open-meteo.com/" target="_blank">Open-Meteo.com</a> APIs, we gather weather data and predict the chance of any disruption to the flight.</p>
            <h2 className="header">How do our predictions work?</h2>
            <p>We retrieve an hourly forecast for the arrival and departure locations from the Open-Meteo.com Forecast API. Each hour of the forecast has a numerical code specifying the category, and therefore the severity, of the weather during that hour. The codes follow the The World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) weather interpretation codes and are shown in the table below.</p>

            <p id="weathercode-example">Using these codes as a basis, we created a simple model to assign a likelihood of delay to each weather condition. As an example, code 2 represents partly cloudy conditions. This is unlikely to cause disruption to air travel and is assigned a low probability of delay/cancellation. Code 67 on the other hand represents heavy freezing rain which is highly dangerous for aircraft and is assigned a high probability of flight delays/cancellations.</p>
            <p>We then review the forecast in the hour of the schuduled departure/arrival and a three-hour window prior to departure/arrival to cover any situations where previous poor weather conditions could cause knock-on delays/cancellations. We then categorise each weather windows using a traffic light system (i.e. low, medium and high probability that a flight may get delayed or cancelled) and display these to the user.</p>
            <p>Note that due to the data available, <i>AeroSure</i> can only provide predictions for flights within 15 days of the current date.</p>
            <h2 className="header">Example prediction</h2>
            <img id="prediction-image" src={prediction}></img>
            <p>Let's look at the above example flight from JFK to LAX. The departure from New York City seems unlikely to be affected by weather because it will be overcast (safe conditions for take-off). However, turning to the arrival in Los Angeles, we can see that fog is predicted at the scheduled arrival time and remains for another hour until clearing up. Foggy conditions can present a problem for aircraft therefore any flights scheduled in the hour of 14:00 or 15:00 are given a high chance of being delayed or cancelled. Looking further ahead to 16:00 we can see that the weather is forecast to be clear. Despite the good conditions at that time, it is possible that the previous predicted disruption is causing knock-on delays or cancellations. Taking both the departure and arrival conditions into account we can say that this flight is likely to be delayed due to adverse weather.</p>
